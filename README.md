# MA244-Analysis-III-Revision
Personal revision on MA244 Analysis III, learn from tutorial sheet and past papers.

So this repository will mainly focus on two parts, support class questions and past papers. I will provide the pdf made by myself so there will not be any problems about license. 


## Lecture notes

The most important part is of course the lecture notes, feel free to download the 2022 version.

## Support Class questions

Below are all the support class questions I have done, and it is divided into weekly sections, feel free to download the complete version created by myself.

### Week 2

[MA244_Analysis_III_week2.pdf](https://github.com/Louisli0515/MA244-Analysis-III-Revision/files/11045440/MA244_Analysis_III_week2.pdf)

In week 2's support class questions, the most important concept is Riemann integrable. 

* Let $f:\left[a,b\right]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function. Then $f$ is integrable if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a partition $P$ of $\left[a,b\right]$ such that $$U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon.$$ 
* Intuitively, $$L(f,P)\leq \int_{a}^{b}f\leq U(f,P).$$

Don't forget refinement as well!!!

* A partition $Q = \set{J_{1},...,J_{l}}$ of $\left[a,b\right]$ is a refinement of a partition $P = \set{I_{1},...,I_{n}}$ if every interval $I_{k}$ in $P$ is the union of one or more intervals $J_{k}$ from the partition $Q$.
